summary: Radial Perfusion Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging Using Deep Learning Image Reconstruction
abstract: "Myocardial perfusion assessment using cardiac MRI allows non-invasive assessment of myocardial ischemia. In myocardial perfusion sequence, imaging is collected after a saturation pulse. An alternative approach based on steady-state imaging with radial sampling has been recently proposed. However, image reconstruction using compressed sensing in steady-state myocardial perfusion remains long and clinically not feasible. In this study, we sought to develop a deep learning-based image reconstruction platform for myocardial perfusion imaging."

Slides can be added in a few ways:

- **Create** slides using Wowchemy's [*Slides*](https://wowchemy.com/docs/managing-content/#create-slides) feature and link using `slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Upload** an existing slide deck to `static/` and link using `url_slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Embed** your slides (e.g. Google Slides) or presentation video on this page using [shortcodes](https://wowchemy.com/docs/writing-markdown-latex/).

Further event details, including [page elements](https://wowchemy.com/docs/writing-markdown-latex/) such as image galleries, can be added to the body of this page. -->
